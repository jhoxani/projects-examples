  <h2>Why didn’t you review [insert name here]’s latest disc?</h2>
  <p>Literally hundreds of new albums are released each week and arrive at FAVORITE HOUSE's offices, all seeking print and online reviews and/or mentions. It is physically impossible to cover all of them within the magazine or online. FAVORITE-HOUSE's experts choose various titles to review based on retail and airplay potential, as well as artistic merit.</p>

  <h2>Can you tell me how high an artist charted?</h2>
